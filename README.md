Analyzing red and blue side playstyles in League of Legends

Every year, there is a worldwide tournament where the best professional teams from across the world are invitied to compete to become the best team in the world. This tournament started again last month, and I have been following along. Although League of Legends players and analysts know that the blue side has a slightly higher win rate (55%) than the red side, not much analysis is done to explain why. I wanted to find data that would help examine differences in playstyles.

I scraped data from the Games of Legends site to examine playstyles. Code for the scraper as well as code used to clean the data to prepare for analysis are included in this repository. In the feeback folder, there is documented feedback from classmates as I worked throughout this data analysis project. The scraped data set (loldata.csv) and cleaned data set (loldata_cleaned.csv) are included here as well.
